# Roblox Game Modifications

Welcome to the **Comet Development**! This repository contains scripts and modifications for Roblox games **Doors** and **Doors Floor 2**.

## Overview

This project aims to enhance gameplay by providing various modifications through scripts. Whether you're looking to satiate bordom or learn a new thing, you'll find something here.

## Features

- **Non-Obfuscated Scripts**: All non-obfuscated scripts are open source and available for anyone to use, modify, and share.
- **Obfuscated Scripts**: Please note that obfuscated scripts are not open source. They are provided for use only and should not be redistributed, as their primary purpose is to remain in this repository as a place to be found easily. (I welcome the challenge however)
